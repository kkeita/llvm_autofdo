create_llvm_prof replacement using llvm-symbolizer and llvm-readelf as replacement for the external dependencies.
This is meant to be a dropped in replacement.

TODO:

Add a way to capture the size of both function symbols and function inline symbol in the profile
Add more testing
Change the llvm-symbolizer to make it match addr2line behavior to simplify testing

Change the sample loading/addling api

1 - Have only one place where we decide whether we are using rangeCountMap or  address_count_map
2 - Introduce SampleLocation as a way to represent a sample in a way that supports multiple objectfiles
3 - Remove branch_count_map_ which doesnt seem used right now



QUESTIONS on the algo :

Details on the reason on how we use the lbr data :  aren't we over sampling by counting samples on all the ranges
in the lbr

What exactly is the branch_map doing ?

Logging api ?
