create_llvm_prof replacement using llvm-symbolizer and llvm-readelf as replacement for the external dependencies.
This is meant to be a dropped in replacement.


Main source code difference :


Main visible difference with create_llvm_prof:

1 - We only symbolize address with sample count, which manifest as not having lines with zero count in the profile.
2 - Because the llvm-symbolizer library is able to find more linkage name than addr2line, we see more target branch name and
    more function name are manglenamed
3 - There is no longer a hard minimum limit of 10 sample on which functions should be included in the profile. The --threshold 
    flags is the only limit applied. 
4 - Only supports ELF64 for now
5 - Preliminary support for .so : 
    - new perfparser for parsing "perf script -F ip,brstack" outputs 
    - added support for multiple .text regions ( Sample address are now converted in {objectFile,ObjectOffset} pairs)
